# Github Actions 

DevOps became very imprtant for organiztions willing to automate and modernaze their workloads. Thanks to its capabilities, it is never been easier create a pipelin that can do all the required staps to build 'almost' any kind of application and deploy 'almost' to any environment. All of this with a click of a button.

Not only that, using DevOps features makes it possible to secure the pipelines when managing secrets or when connecting to the target production environment. That become today what is known as DevSecOps.

Many known tools are available to inplement DevOps like Jenkins, Gitlab CI, Azure DevOps Pipelines and many more. Github Actions is one of these tools. It did become popular from the first day it was launched back in 2018. That success was due to the popularity of Github as a platform to host the source code used by more than 50 million users. It was very natural to use the same platform to build and deploy that code into production.
